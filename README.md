Personal Budget Manager
Description: The Personal Budget Manager is a simple application that allows users to track their expenses and manage their budget. This project will challenge students to create a user-friendly interface where they can add, update, and visualize their spending in various categories.

Core Features:

Add Expense: Users can input details about each expense, including the amount, date, and category.
View Expenses: Display a list of all expenses, which can be filtered by date and category.
Expense Summary: Provide a visual summary of expenses, such as a pie chart or bar graph, to show spending by category.
Budget Limits: Allow users to set budget limits for each category and show alerts when nearing the limit.
Technical Requirements:

Components: Use functional components with hooks.
Props: Pass data and functions between components using props.
State Management: Use local state management with React's useState.
Reducers: Implement useReducer for handling complex state logic, especially for managing the list of expenses and budget limits.
Implementation Steps:

Setup Basic Layout: Create the main layout with placeholders for each feature.
Implement Core Features: Build out the functionality for adding and viewing expenses.
Integrate Charting Library: Use a charting library like Chart.js to add visual expense summaries.
Add Budget Alerts: Implement alerts using conditional rendering based on budget thresholds.
